Hi, This is Ke Xie, a python and Golang programmer

my github: https://github.com/kneed

Graduated from Guangzhou Medical University with a major in biomedical engineering. Since I was in contact with computers since I was a child, I became interested in computers. After I took the course of C language design in my sophomore year, I developed a strong interest in computers. Computers at that time did not seem to be that popular. Almost still Wen Zhaolun, it is a gathering place for programmers.Under the influence of the wheel brother who graduated from Royal South China University of Technology (laughs), he started to learn C++ related content.

In the three years of university, I have read *C++ primer*, *C++ primer plus* (this is a bit of a copycat C++ primer, haha, but the content layout personally feels that it will be more suitable for novices to get started than C++ primer) *Effective C++*, * TCP/IP protocol*, *In-depth understanding of computer systems*. After reading these books, I basically have a comprehensive and large-scale understanding of the design of modern programming languages. It is also for the later learning of Python, Go and Java, Javascript and other languages Knowing has played a very important help.

**Why is it a Python and Golang backend?**

Simply put, it is because I missed the very important autumn recruitment and spring recruitment for the corresponding graduates. When I realized its importance, it was already the end of the recruitment of major companies, and because I wanted to find a job first, I had to face it. A game company’s planning-related work. Now that I think about it, it seems to be lucky that I didn’t come to the end. After graduation, I looked at the introduction on the recruitment website, and they all required at least one year of work experience. I was deeply lost in thought. And C++ There are really not many jobs in Guangzhou. The big factories are naturally not short of people. I remember that there are only a few game companies who use C++ in small factories, and I also called to ask if they can use erlang. Poor is thinking about change. At the time, Python seemed to be more popular. , So it took more than two months to learn the Python language, did a few crawler projects, and found the first job in Blue Shield with this resume hhh.

Since then, my work is basically Python. When I was learning Go at AAM, the leader asked if he was interested in doing Go refactoring projects. In fact, because of the popularity of Go, I already have a basic understanding of it. So I started with the leader. The road to Go's refactoring project.

**What do you think of the career of programmers?**

In my eyes, programmers should include development, architecture, and technical research.

For development, you can complete the development work by mastering the relevant content of language and computer principles. As for development efficiency, it depends on various tools to improve. The future of development I think will be more and more streamlined. Because of modern language standards The specification will continue to reduce the code differences between developers. And in the context of more and more refined division of labor, the development work of large factories requires more knowledge but the actual work content seems to be reduced.

For architecture, it is mainly to master a large number of tool chains, to combine these tool chains, combined with basic architectural design principles, to meet the problems in the actual project operation. This part of the work will also be due to the open source sharing spirit of the Internet industry , It becomes easier and easier. Because you are in a country with 1.3 billion people and 900 million people online, large companies like Tencent and Ali have precipitated related architecture designs to meet various scenarios. As an architecture Teacher, most of the time you no longer need to start from scratch.

For technical research, it is to study cutting-edge technology or implement it yourself to solve some actual needs. For example, why does Google do K8s, why does LinkedIn do kafka, it was done in order to meet current needs at the beginning In the end, it was very easy to use and open sourced. Therefore, a technical research needs to know what current needs are, whether they can be well met now, and whether they can find a way to solve them.

For myself, according to the common technical route and management route, I feel that whether it is intelligence or energy, I am at a very good stage of my understanding. Everything should be able to be within a reasonable time frame. To achieve it. As a programmer, it's great to solve all kinds of meaningful needs.
